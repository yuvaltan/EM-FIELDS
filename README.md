# EM-FIELDS
: A simulation that calculates and plots the Electro-magnetic fields inside a coaxial area, from a given boundary potential.

A coaxial cabel using the electric potential on his boundaries to make EM fields. 
In this simulation you can see the given potential, the electric field that it creats, and by using Maxwell's equasions it calculates the magnetic fields. You can beautifully see the differences of the behavior of these two fields.
Also shows the propagation inside a transmission line. (Less interesting in my opinion).
